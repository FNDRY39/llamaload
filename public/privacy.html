      <h1>Privacy & Cookies Policy</h1>
      <div class="updated">Last updated: 10 January 2026</div>

      <p>
        This Privacy & Cookies Policy explains how llamaload.com (“we”, “us” or
        “the Service”) collects, uses, and safeguards information when you use
        the website and related services.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Who operates this service</h2>
      <p>
        llamaload.com is a small independent project. If you have questions
        about this policy, you can reach the creator at:
        <a href="mailto:hello@llamaload.com">hello@llamaload.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>
      <h3>2.1. Information you provide directly</h3>
      <p>
        When you use the core tool, you provide website URLs that you want to
        generate mockups for. These URLs are processed by the service in order
        to take screenshots, but are not intended to be stored or associated
        with your identity on an ongoing basis.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2. Usage and technical data</h3>
      <p>
        Like most web services, basic technical information may be collected
        automatically, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address and approximate region</li>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Operating system</li>
        <li>Pages visited and actions taken (e.g. generating a mockup)</li>
        <li>Date and time of requests</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is used to operate, secure, and improve the Service.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3. Third-party services</h3>
      <p>
        If analytics or payment services (such as “Buy the creator a coffee”)
        are integrated, those providers may collect additional data in
        accordance with their own privacy policies. You should review those
        third-party policies when using their services.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How your data is used</h2>
      <p>We use information for purposes such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operating and maintaining the core mockup generation features</li>
        <li>Monitoring performance and reliability</li>
        <li>Preventing abuse and troubleshooting issues</li>
        <li>
          Understanding aggregate usage patterns to inform improvements to the
          Service
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Data is not sold to third parties. If third-party analytics or payment
        tools are used, they may process information as independent controllers.
      </p>

            <h2>4. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
      <p>
        The Service uses cookies and similar technologies to support core
        functionality and, with your consent, analytics via Google Analytics.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1. Essential cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Essential cookies are used to remember choices such as cookie consent.
        These are required for the site to function as expected and cannot
        usually be disabled without affecting the basic operation of the site.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2. Analytics cookies (Google Analytics)</h3>
      <p>
        With your consent, the Service uses Google Analytics to collect
        aggregated information about how visitors use llamaload.com. This may
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on them</li>
        <li>Buttons or features clicked</li>
        <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
        <li>Device, browser, and operating system information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Google Analytics uses cookies and similar technologies to perform this
        measurement. Data collected through Google Analytics is processed by
        Google in accordance with Google’s own
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Privacy Policy
        </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytics cookies are only activated after you click “Accept” in the
        cookie banner. Until you give consent, Google Analytics is not loaded.
        You can withdraw your consent at any time by clearing cookies in your
        browser.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3. Managing cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Your browser typically allows you to control cookies through its
        settings, including blocking or deleting cookies. Note that disabling
        cookies may impact how the Service functions. If you delete cookies,
        the cookie banner may reappear and you may be asked to provide your
        consent again.
      </p>


      <h2>5. Data sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Data may be shared with trusted third parties that help operate the
        Service, such as hosting providers or analytics vendors, under
        appropriate safeguards. Data may also be disclosed if required by law
        or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Service, its
        users, or others.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        Technical logs and usage data are retained for as long as necessary to
        operate and improve the Service, and to meet legal or security
        requirements. URL inputs and generated screenshots are generally
        processed transiently to fulfill your request, and are not intended to
        be retained longer than necessary for that purpose.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights under applicable data
        protection laws, which can include the right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request access to personal data held about you</li>
        <li>Request correction or deletion of personal data</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain types of processing</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise any rights or ask questions, contact
        <a href="mailto:hello@llamaload.com">hello@llamaload.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may be hosted or processed on servers located in other
        countries. By using the Service, you understand that your information
        may be processed in jurisdictions that may have different data
        protection laws than your own.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Third-party links</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may link to external sites (for example, “Buy the creator a
        coffee” or external documentation). This policy does not cover those
        external sites, and you should review their privacy policies separately.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy & Cookies Policy may be updated from time to time to
        reflect changes to the Service or applicable laws. The “Last updated”
        date at the top of this page will be revised when changes are made.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        For questions about this policy or your data, contact:
        <a href="mailto:hello@llamaload.com">hello@llamaload.com</a>.

        This page is provided for general informational purposes only and does
